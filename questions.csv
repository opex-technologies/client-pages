Do you offer circuit management,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,"Cato dynamically monitors the quality of each Internet circuit to make real-time decisions upon failover between circuits to maintain user experience and availability. The thresholds for detecting a “Brown-out” situation are entirely configurable by the customer's administrators.
Additionally, Cato offers an additional service to proactively monitor customers’ Internet circuits and raise ISP support tickets on the customer's behalf through resolution. Cato Intelligent last-mile Management (ILMM) is a global, last-mile monitoring and management service designed for today’s enterprise. 
Cato ILMM monitors the complete last mile from the site through the ISP to the Cato PoP for brownout and blackout detection. 
Instead of being limited to the router's capabilities, Cato uses its Cato Socket for last-mile monitoring. By default, Cato Sockets measure latency, loss, and jitter using four different methods — DNS, HTTP, ping, and traceroute — although custom services can also be defined. Test results are then compared against the link profile generated during the onboarding process. Cato uses its data warehouse capabilities to construct detailed profiles of last-mile performance for each monitored service. These profiles are continuously updated to reflect seasonal variations in traffic conditions. By comparing test results against the link profiles, Cato can detect brownouts, not just link outages. 
Once problems are identified, Cato proactively works with ISPs to resolve them to minimize or eliminate user impact. Detailed reports backed by extensive logs identify the source of networking problems, shortening the time for ISPs to resolve problems. 
While most last-mile monitoring services stop at the ISP’s premises, Cato’s ILMM monitors the link from the Cato Socket through the ISP and all the way to the Cato PoP around the clock, seven days a week, 365 days a year. ",5,10,No,3,6,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,"Yes, Proactive and Reactive",5,10,,

Traffic Handling (packet or session),10,Session,1,2,Packet,5,10,Packet,5,10,"The Cato service delivers prioritization end-to-end from the point of the Cato socket device to the destination Cato socket. Customers can define and manage prioritization and bandwidth from a centralized location with as much granularity as required. Configuring the organization's QoS policies is done through BW Management profiles. These profiles define priorities and limit upstream/downstream bandwidth to a fixed speed or a percentage of the total bandwidth.
 
Analyzing QoS in real time or viewing historical data: When configuring a Cato site within the Cato Management Application (CMA), the administrator also configures the upstream/downstream bandwidth capacity. In this way, the Cato Cloud is aware of each link's capacity and can further leverage it in the QoS engine.
 
As part of the QoS engine, Cato continuously monitors each link’s quality matrix (congestion, packet loss, jitter, latency) and dynamically sends traffic over the best available link as configured in the PBR. Furthermore, Cato uses Weighted Random Early Drop (WRED). Before discarding a packet (due to lack of capacity), Cato buffers a minimum threshold of 250 packets and an upper threshold of 500 packets. You can analyze discarded packets using the analytics view.
 
Network rules allow the administrator to define Policy-Based Routing to steer traffic over Cato or other available transport paths (such as MPLS) while also controlling ISP Circuit selection, Packet Loss Mitigation, and more. The network rules can be based on Src / Dst, AD User or User Group, Application or Application Group, Service, and manually defined logical grouping.
 
The PBR comprises the following main functions:
 
• Transport Selection: you can define through which transport (such as Cato or Alt. WAN) to transfer specific traffic. For example, if a site has Alt. WAN (MPLS) as well as an internet link, you can define a PBR where certain WAN traffic is directed over MPLS while the remaining traffic and internet is directed over the Cato Cloud
• NIC Selection: you can define through which NIC to transfer specific traffic. For example, if a site has multiple internet lines, you can define a PBR where one NIC is used for all business apps while another NIC is used for non-business apps.
• Egressing or NAT from the Cato Cloud: you can select via which PoP(s) or IP(s) specific traffic should be egressed from the Cato Cloud, as explained in the following examples:
• Egressing from a specific location (Route via): If you want to optimize specific internet traffic to egress from the Cato Cloud closer to the target location, or to egress specific locations for localization purposes.
  
For each BW Management profile, you assign a number defining its priority. When you assign these prioritized profiles to the Network Rules, you effectively implement traffic prioritization, including throttling traffic per defined limits in the BW Management profile when links are congested.
 
 
Cato provides a set of predefined priorities (which can be added, modified, or deleted) assigned to the predefined network rules as follows:
  
P10: Prioritizing Voice & Video traffic across WAN and Internet
P20: Prioritizing RDP traffic across WAN and Internet
P30: Prioritizing SMB traffic across WAN and Internet
P40: Prioritizing the rest of the WAN traffic
Default: Prioritizing the rest of the Internet traffic is used as default priority when a Networking Rule doesn’t have a QoS context (meaning no specific priority should be assigned).",5,10,Yes,5,10,Per Session based,3,6,Packet and Session,3,6,"Packet for VeloCloud and BigLeaf, Session for Fortinet",5,10,Depending on platform (we have both),3,6,Windstream does have solutions which support both features.,3,6,"Near-Real Time Dynamic Routing uses software-defined networking to route your network traffic.

Routing on SLA-backed carriers end-to-end eliminates the packet loss incurred during carrier peering.

As proxies, the PoPs make distant destination appear closer to TCP clients and servers, which allows them to set large TCP windows. As a result, clients and servers can pass far more data at once before waiting for acknowledgement. Azure environments (IaaS) can be connected to Cato Cloud and enjoy all the above mentioned benefits. Cato Cloud eliminates the need for express routes as packets will always take the optimal route to the destination and Cato pop's are strategically placed near big cloud egress points for good connectivity.

Customers can define and manage prioritization and bandwidth from a centralized location with as much granularity as required:

• Configuring organization's QoS policies through BW Management profiles. These profiles define priorities and limit upstream/downstream bandwidth to either a fixed speed or a percentage of the total bandwidth.

• Analyzing QoS in real-time or viewing historical data

When you configure a Cato site within Cato Management Console, the administrator can also configure the upstream/downstream bandwidth capacity. In this way, the Cato Cloud is aware of the capacity of each link, and can further leverage it in the QoS engine.

As part of the QoS engine, Cato continuously monitors each link’s quality matrix (congestion, packet loss, jitter, latency) and dynamically sends traffic over the best available link and as per configured in the PBR.

Furthermore, Cato uses Weighted Random Early Drop (WRED). Prior to discarding a packet (due to lack of capacity), Cato buffers a minimum threshold of 250 packets and an upper threshold of 500 packets. You can analyze discarded packets using Cato Management Console's Site Analytics section.

Networks Rules allow the administrator to define Policy Based Routing to steer traffic over Cato or other available Transport paths, whilst also controlling ISP Circuit selection, Packet Loss Mitigation, and more. The Network rules can based upon, Src / Dst, AD User or User Group, Application or Application Group, Service, and manually defined logical grouping.

The PBR comprises the following main functions:

• Transport Selection: you can define through which transport (such as Cato or Alt. WAN) to transfer specific traffic. For example, if a site has Alt. WAN (MPLS) as well as an internet link, you can define a PBR where certain WAN traffic is directed over MPLS while the remaining traffic and internet is directed over the Cato Cloud

• NIC Selection: you can define through which NIC to transfer specific traffic. For example, if a site has multiple internet lines, you can define a PBR where one NIC is used for all business apps, while another NIC is used for non-business apps.

• Egressing or NAT from the Cato Cloud: you can select via which PoP(s) or IP(s) should specific traffic be egressed from

the Cato Cloud, as explained in the following examples:

• Egressing from a specific location (Route via): If you want to optimize specific internet traffic to egress from the Cato Cloud closer to the target location, or to egress specific locations for localization purposes.

• NAT with a specific IP: If you need to egress with a specific IP to gain secure access to applicable SaaS applications (for example, egressing Salesforce traffic with a specific IP from Cato Cloud and populating that IP in Salesforce's whitelist increases overall security, and forces users to access Salesforce from the Cato Cloud, benefiting from the Cato Cloud Security Services Stack).

For each BW Management profile, you assign a number defining its priority. When you assign these prioritized profiles to the Network Rules, you effectively implement traffic prioritization which includes, when links are congested, throttling of traffic as per defined limits in the BW Management profile.

Cato provides a set of predefined priorities (as which can be added, modified, deleted) assigned to the predefined network rules as follows:

Dynamic path selection

Using the Cato Socket device (see attached data sheets), ISP circuit selection can be made automatically based on line quality (jitter, latency, packet loss) and also load balancing based on bandwidth availability over multiple ISP circuits. Additionally, the path selection be directed via business focused policies to ensure the traffic prefers specific circuits, based on matching criteria such as, Application type, User or User group, src / dst etc. This does not preclude non-preferred circuit from also acting as a backup should the first fail or become over contended.

Application optimisation

Cato takes the approach of network level optimisations rather than application level. With application level optimisations, comes significant administrative overhead per application, the risk of breaking an applications communications, and ongoing maintenance upon application changes and upgrades. Cato takes the approach of leveraging a Tier 1 based, SLA-backed backbone to form a low latency and predictable middle mile. Leveraging this backbine, Cato then implements TCP acceleration, providing optimisation at a network level, benefiting all applications, without the adminsitrative overhead.


Performance based routing

As well as having full control to set a preferred circuit for specific applications, users / user groups, sources and destinations, the Cato solution defines thresholds which if reached dictate the circuit path selected for traffic.

Dynamic cloud access

Cato connects IaaS locations to the Cato Network using either a vSocket or IPSec tunnel, resulting in the same visibility, access and control as physical locations. The Cloud environments can then be accessed from other Cato-Connected locations and also mobile users with the Cato Client installed.

Layer 4 firewalling

Layer 4 firewalling is supported on the Cato Socket device to provide control between locally LAN subnets, without the requirement for the traffic to first pass into the Cato Cloud for inspection. This maintains a low latency and line speed connectivity.

One of the most unique and compelling benefits of Cato's POP-based architecture is our ability to provide QoS over public Internet. Unlike any other vendor in our vertical, we control both ends of the last mile. Like an MPLS provider we control outbound traffic from the site to our POP. We also control inbound traffic from the POP to the site. This enables some very nice capabilities we can deliver over Public Internet: All SD-WAN vendors can prioritize data for outbound traffic. Cato is the only vendor who can provide inbound QoS typically reserved only to MPLS providers. For any application (internally hosted or SaaS), Cato can protect EF and mission-critical data on the inbound path. For example we can guard against VoIP or critical ERP traffic from experiencing loss-based congestion caused by a large FTP transfer, YouTube video or other bandwidth hungry applications. Without MPLS, no other SD-WAN vendor can make this same claim. Finally, we can rate limit inbound WWW and Best Effort traffic before it hits the bottleneck of the last mile.

Cato uses this capability to detect all potential high-risk file types, defeating evasion techniques that are used by either attackers or misconfigured webapplications. This engine is also used by Cato IPS providing more context during flow analysis and acts as a key factor in detection of malicious network behavior.
• Malware Detection and Prevention leverages multi-layered and tightly-integrated anti-malware engines.

The converged software stack utilizes Cato unique Single Pass Architecture Engine (SPACE) which enables a unified view and decision process in contrast to the chaining of siloed stand-alone products. The same processing is applied to all traffic, including remotely connected users. Lastly, Cato's SASE Cloud offers single-pane-of-glass management, covering all security and networking services in a unified console.
 
Besides Inline CASB, Cato provides out-of-band (API-based) capabilities. 
SaaS Security API gives the ability to also monitor and react to traffic from remote users that connect directly to the cloud apps. This applies even when they are not using the SDP Client to send traffic over the Cato Cloud.
SaaS Security API inspects the content of a connection without using TLS Inspection. This is especially benificial to accounts that don't have TLS Inspection enabled. However, even for accounts that are using TLS Inspection, some cloud apps can't be inspected due to issues related to certificate pinning. SaaS Security API compliments Cato's inline CASB and DLP solutions to provide the best security coverage.",5,10,Yes (as an available addon),5,10,Inline only,5,10,Yes,5,10,No,0,0,Yes depending on platform,3,6,"Yes, Windstream does have solutions which support that feature.",5,10,Yes,5,10,,
DLP,10,Optional licesnsing - requires customer discovery,5,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,"Cato's DLP is delivered as part of a SASE Cloud service and provides coverage for all traffic to all enterprise assets (premise datacenter, cloud, SaaS). This includes on-prem applications hosted in the enterprise’s physical data centers, which most DLP solutions do not have visibility into and therefore do not cover. Additionally, Cato's DLP follows Zero Trust principles in which we can define DLP rules for applications and activities for which no explicit rules have been defined. This means that we can enforce restrictive policies for unsanctioned applications (AKA shadow IT) and ensure sensitive content isn't uploaded to, or downloaded from, these applications before we have had a chance to better understand their purpose and potential risk.
Cato's Security Service Edge, SSE 360 , which is part of Cato's Secure Access Service Edge (SASE), converges DLP with additional application access and threat mitigation services. Cato SSE 360 uses a Single Pass Cloud Engine (SPACE) to employ these services concurrently and with a shared context, enabling each one visibility into information collected and processed by the others, to enable them to make better informed decisions.

The metadata of all traffic flows is stored in a massive data warehouse for further processing by machine learning algorithms and human researchers. The resulting insights allow Cato to deliver detailed security and networking insights, such as those necessary for threat hunting. Such insights are unavailable with traditional telco services.
With all Internet and WAN-bound traffic able to pass through the Cato Cloud in route to the destination, Cato provides optimization, predictability, security and visibility on all traffic.
Visibility is not limited to security violations, but covers Analytics on all traffic, providing realtime and historical visibility with the following granularity:
Per application
Per domain
Per user / host
Per URL category
Realtime and historical representation of lastmile Jitter, Latency and Packet loss are augmented by detailed data usage visibility.
 
Additionally, Cato offers a Last Mile Monitoring service (see attached) to monitor last-mile from the site through the ISP all the way to the Cato PoP for brownout and blackout detection. Rather than being limited to the capabilities of the router, Cato uses its Cato Socket for last-mile monitoring. By default, Cato Sockets measure latency, loss, jitter using four different methods — DNS, HTTP, ping, and traceroute — although custom services can also be defined. Test results are then compared against the link profile generated during the onboarding process. Cato uses its data warehouse capabilities to construct detailed profiles of last-mile performance for each monitored service. These profiles are continuously updated to reflect seasonal variations in traffic conditions. By comparing test results against the link profiles, Cato can detect brownouts not just link outages.
Once problems are identified, Cato proactively works with ISPs to resolve them to minimize or eliminate the impact on users.

For Cato, this is only the beginning of our WAN capabilities.Cato’s unique Multi-Segment Optimization combines edge- and backbone-specific optimizations, allowing us to optimize routing and maximize throughput end-to-end to both physical and cloud destinations. For Cato, the key to performance is not so much what vendors do at the edge with SD-WAN parlor tricks, it is what we do between our POPs (the middle mile) to guarantee a truly better experience for our users.
Within the middle-mile, Cato PoPs choose the best, SLA-backed carrier for every packet. Routing on SLA-backed carriers end-to-end eliminates the packet loss incurred during carrier peering. With the optimum network determined, Cato PoPs act as TCP proxies, dramatically improving end-to-end TCP throughput. As proxies, the PoPs make distant destination appear close to TCP clients and servers, which allows them to set large TCP windows. As a result, clients and servers can pass far more data at once before waiting for acknowledgement.",5,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,,,0,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,"Yes, Windstream does have solutions which support that feature.",5,10, ,,0,,

Cato is a SaaS platform that includes a ZTNA client for remote access and an SD-WAN appliance for SASE deployments.

At the basis of Cato’s SASE platform is a cloud-based secure network platform: Cato SASE Cloud. Cato took a cloud-first approach to its architecture and all functionality that could be delivered from the cloud, was placed in the cloud including global routing, network security, WAN optimization, and cloud acceleration. Cato deployed its network in 75+ fully redundant PoPs worldwide, where the full range of capabilities is available at all PoPs. Each PoP includes multiple symmetrical processing nodes, interconnected by multiple SLA-backed backbone providers. Next, Cato implemented a “thin client” approach to connect all edges to the Cato Cloud using encrypted tunnels. Edges includes Cato Socket SD-WAN appliances, any IPSec-enabled device (like edge firewalls), VPN-enabled cloud providers like AWS and Azure (agentless), and Cato VPN clients to tunnel a single device traffic into the Cato Cloud. This architecture is delivers HA by design. All edges automatically seek the nearest PoP and migrate to the next available PoP if the current PoP becomes unreachable. This requires no pre-planning or manual intervention. Traffic flows are processed inside each POP by the Cato SPACE engines using a single-pass scanning approach that processes the traffic in parallel and avoid the limitations and performance-related issues of a service-chain model. More info on our SPACE engine can be found in the attached document.",5,10,Yes,5,10,Subscribed Cloud firewalls can be included as client gateways for remote client users.,3,6,Yes,5,10,NA,0,0,Yes depending clients platform,3,6,"Yes, Windstream does have solutions which support that feature.",5,10, ,,0,,
Auto-select nearest POP,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,Yes,5,10,"The Cato Cloud is a converged platform to connect, secure and manage Coastal's network. Coastal Credit Union can gradually deploy Cato across branches, cloud resources, and users to replace or augment legacy network services and security point solutions.
At the core, Cato built a global private backbone of 93+ POPs (still growing) running our converged software stack. The PoPs are interconnected with redundant Tier-1 providers that commit to SLAs around long-haul latency, jitter, and packet loss. The PoP software selects the best route across providers, for maximum uptime and best end-to-end performance. This design offers an immediate improvement in network quality over the unpredictable Public internet, and a significant cost reduction over MPLS. 
Cato process every packet through multiple engines.
For network processing:
 -  Cato calculates the best routes globally for every packet, over the best preforming provider – this also creates high resiliency in case of a provider degradation or outage.
  - Cato accelerates WAN traffic by maximizing bandwidth for activities such as file downloads and voice calls.
  - And, it optimizes cloud access by routing application-specific traffic to the PoP closest to the cloud destination.
Cato then inspects packets for security.
 - All traffic, including encrypted traffic, can be inspected by multiple security engines.
 - These include a next generation firewall with application awareness, secure web gateway with URL filtering, and advanced threat prevention with next gen anti-malware and IPS.
 - Security policies apply to all resources including physical locations, cloud resources, and mobile users.
Customer connect all network edges to the cloud network using secure tunnels. Physical locations connect via Cato Socket SD-WAN devices. The Cato Socket manages multiple last mile connections in active/active mode. It moves traffic to the best path based on underlying link behaviour. The socket also applies quality of service prioritization based on application and user awareness. And, it protects critical apps like voice against packet loss. Cato provides a broad set of policies out of the box that optimize traffic for the most common requirements, with the ability to configure highly granular policies for specific needs.
Cato Sockets also support site-to-site MPLS and Internet connections for regional use cases and for bandwidth intensive applications with low security exposure like backup. Customers that don’t care for edge SD-WAN capabilities, can establish IPSec tunnels from existing routers or firewalls to the nearest PoP and get the network and security benefits or the backbone with a zero on-site footprint.
Combining Cato’s Edge SD-WAN capabilities for last mile optimization, with Cato’s backbone middle mile optimizations allows JGSHI to augment or replace MPLS and deliver optimal service to all locations globally or regionally.
Beyond physical locations, Cato connects cloud resources (e.g. AWS, Microsoft Azure) and mobile users to the network.
A mobile user can use the Cato Client or a browser, to securely connect to any WAN or cloud application from a laptop, tablets, and smartphones. The users dynamically connect to the nearest PoP as they move from place to place. Traffic is then optimized and secure over the backbone and to the destination.
Cloud datacenters are connected by establishing an IPSEC tunnel from the Cato Cloud or using a Cato virtual socket. This makes the cloud datacenter an integral part of the network and its traffic benefits from all network optimization and security controls.
For public cloud applications, no integration is required. Application-specific traffic from any edge is automatically detected. Traffic can be sent, based on a network rule, to the PoP closest to the cloud instance serving the business.
Finally, Cato offers a flexible management model. A Self-service console if available for Coastal to configure all networking and security policies for the entire system. Cato and its partners can deliver a fully managed service for customers who want it.
The Cato Cloud is a future proof network for the digital business. As needed, Cato can be gradually deployed across use cases while coexisting with your network and security infrastructure. ",5,10,"For SSL VPN this is available through a couple of means we can discuss.
